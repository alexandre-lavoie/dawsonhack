# Challenge
The first Dawson College Hackathon was divided in two sections. The robot had to be able to perform one or both of the following:
1. Determine the longest distance in a 4x4 meter square.
2. Creative and ingenous design to the problem.

# Parts
* Robot Body Kit
* 2 Wheels with Rubber Grip
* 1 Swivel Wheel
* Arduino Nano (CH340)
* 1 Servo Motor
* 2 Motors (Driven by 2ch-sn-controller)
* 1 Feetech 2ch-sn-controller (For Motors)
* 1 Keychain Powerbank

# Schematic

This is a basic representation of the circuit (using parts found on tinkercad)

# Coding

All the coding for this robot can be found in the Main package.

# Solutions to Problems Encountered

* The Arduino Nano CH340 requires a special driver that can be found here : http://www.arduined.eu/ch340g-converter-windows-7-driver-download/
* Cleaning the wheels prevents slipping.
* The rechargable battery losing power will yield the robot to turn less.
